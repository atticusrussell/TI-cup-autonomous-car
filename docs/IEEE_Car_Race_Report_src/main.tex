\begin{abstract}
Autonomous vehicles are a novel technology being intensely researched and invested in at this current time. At the Rochester Institute of Technology, the Texas Instruments Cup competition was an opportunity for computer engineering students to apply the skills and knowledge acquired through their coursework to program a small autonomous car to autonomously traverse a racetrack. The major components making up the vehicles used in the competition were a Texas Instruments MSP432 microcontroller, two DC motors to spin the rear wheels for propulsion, a servo for steering the front two wheels, and a 128-pixel line-scan camera with which to perceive the track. The constructed cars of each team competed in a time trial race against cars developed by other teams of students.

\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The goal of competitors in the Texas Instruments (TI) Cup was to design the fastest autonomous car that could complete a lap of an unknown track configuration in a time trial against several other cars. A total of 14 teams of two students were each provided with a TI Cup car kit to assemble, program, and compete with in the race. This kit consisted of a TI MSP432 Microcontroller, a car chassis with four wheels; the rear two driven by two DC motors, and the front two steered using a servo and some steering linkage hardware. The kit also included two batteries for the car, a motor driver shield, a custom board to interface the MSP432 with the motor driver and the other components, a line-scan camera on an adjustable mount to be raised above the car on a pole, and other miscellaneous components. The assembled vehicle is shown in Fig. \ref{fig-sideProfileCar}.

    \caption{The TI Cup Car \cite{CarPhoto}}
    \label{fig-sideProfileCar}
\end{figure}

The specifications of the race were as follows: each team was provided three attempts to complete a full lap of the track, and the first time the car completed a lap was recorded as the official time, and no subsequent attempts to improve the time were allowed. A successful completion of a lap of the track requires that the car has at least two wheels on the track at all times, and completes the lap in less than 60 seconds. The official race track structure as shown in Fig. \ref{fig-trackCorner} was not made known to students until the day of competition. Each  team was allotted 5 minutes of practice time on the competition track prior to the race for further adjustments and tuning.  Timing began when a vehicle broke the beam of a laser-triggered timer at the start line, and ended when it successfully makes a lap around the track and broke the beam a second time. Students were allowed to adjust the camera, use the board's buttons, and change batteries in between attempts, but not to flash new code or make other modifications. 

The TI Cup competition was a chance to apply the skills learned throughout the Interface and Digital Electronics course of Rochester Institute of Technology's Computer Engineering department. Laboratory exercises throughout the course centered on programming a TI MSP432 microcontroller to accomplish various tasks. Some of the previous exercises were extremely relevant to the TI Cup, such as Exercise 5, where students used the Timer32 module of the MSP432 to process data from a line-scan camera \cite{ourLab5}. Also relevant was Exercise 6, where students used the MSP432's TimerA module to implement pulse-width modulation (PWM), and used the PWM functionality to control a DC motor using an H-Bridge, and to directly control a servo \cite{ourLab6}.

This team's goal in the project was to write code for the MSP432 that would allow our TI Cup car to complete a lap of the track in the minimum possible time during the competition. The plan to achieve this was to write reliable and modular C code to control the different components involved in driving, and to write the code in a way allowing different aspects of the car's behavior to be configured through the use of "modes", and different features to also be quickly disabled and re-enabled to ease optimizing the car during development. Through this approach, the intent was to run the car at the maximum possible speed at which it could complete the course, as determined by trial and error, and the use of a modal system would allow the availability of a lower-speed mode to help ensure the successful completion of a lap if the first two attempts were to fail.


% Through applied knowledge gained from the Interface and Digital Electronics course at RIT and experimentation, students were able to design and test programming for an autonomous car to compete for fastest completion time around a unique track. The resources provided and utilized for this project included a TI MSP432 microcontroller, the car attached with direct-current (DC) motors, servo, motor shield, and line-scan camera as well as a kit with essential tools for the car. 

% The uniqueness of this competition is the diverse approaches that the teams utilized to complete the goal. Many teams incorporated the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm into their program design for efficient steering and speed control.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the development process leading up to the competition, strategies of past teams during the TI and NXP Cups, our strategy for implementing a steering algorithm, and further details the components of the car. Section 3 explains the method implemented in the design of the car, and elaborates on our unique approaches. Section 4 presents the experimental results of late testing and the race, and Section 5 contains concluding remarks.


\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Milestones}
The development of this project was divided into three milestones leading up to to the final race. The first milestone was to make the car capable of driving in either direction around a small white oval track, and to detect carpet and stop promptly if it detected it had left the track.  For the second milestone, the car was tested for its ability to navigate intersections utilizing a figure-eight track. The final milestone was the implementation and demonstration of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm in part of the car’s code.

\subsection{Components}
A multitude of components were used to construct the car, and are listed in the Bill of Materials (BOM) in Table \ref{tab:carBOM}. The Texas Instruments MSP432 microcontroller, also known as the microcontroller unit (MCU), was used to control all other components, and was connected to a custom-made interface board. This interface board plugged into the headers on top of the MSP432 and connected the appropriate pins of the microcontroller to a RPi MC33886 motor driver board, while exposing the pins required to interface with the servo, and those to connect to the line-scan camera as shown in Fig. \ref{fig-sideProfileCar}. The RPi driver board connected to the battery, and, in addition to driving the DC motors on the rear wheels of the car, provided the MSP432 with the regulated 5 volt supply required for it to run while on battery. The MCU was connected electrically through the interface board to the MG996R servo motor, which was connected to the front wheels through the use of a steering arm. The brushed DC motors on the rear wheels of the car were from DFRobot's KIT0167. The car was powered using a Tenergy 7.2V 3800 mAh Battery Pack, which was held to the chassis using the zip ties. The MCU was additionally connected to the Parallax TSL1401-DB Line-Scan Camera Module through the interface board.

\subsection{Previous Efforts}
Prior to the TI Cup, students competed in a similar competition called the NXP Cup. The objective of the two races are same in which students program an autonomous car to compete for fastest time around an unknown track, The main difference is that an ARM FRDM-K64F microcontroller was used in the NXP Cup \cite{NXPPaper}, while a TI MSP432 microcontroller, which also utilized an ARM processor, was used in the TI Cup.

In previous competitions similar to the TI Cup, students competing in the TI Cup utilized an algorithm that applied a binary filter on the line-scan data and used the average of those values to establish a threshold that determined the course of the car. The car stopped when the amount of data points went under the threshold and used the average of the data points to steer the car along the track when the points were above the threshold \cite{HarrisonPaper}. 

Another method a previous team used is the bang-bang strategy in which the car is programmed to adjust its speeding automatically depending on the consistency of its navigation. The implementation of this method allows the car to control its speed when it determines a pattern in the types of turns or directions it is going in, however it is not a sophisticated control method, and is not suitable for higher speeds \cite{DantePaper}.

\subsection{PID Control}
PID is a control algorithm that uses feedback to control systems. The algorithm calculates the error between the desired output and the actual output of the system, and applies corrective actions to bring the output closer to the desired value. The three terms in the algorithm, Proportional, Integral, and Derivative, represent different aspects of the error and are used to calculate the corrective action. Fig. \ref{fig-pidBlockDiagram} displays a block diagram of a PID controller in a closed feedback loop. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{figs/pidAttempt3.png}
    \caption{PID Controller Block Diagram \cite{pidDiagram}}
    \label{fig-pidBlockDiagram}
\end{figure}

A quirk of PID control is that it is not always necessary to implement all three of the components, depending on the application. Some systems may only require the use of proportional control, and others may only require proportional and integral, or proportional and derivative, to reach the desired behavior of the system.

\subsection{Line-Scan Camera}
The Parallax Parallax TSL-1401 line-scan camera used in the TI Cup car's design is a critical component, as it is the car's only source of information about its environment, and so data from it forms the basis for all of the car's actions. The line-scan camera measures 128 pixels of light intensity in a horizontal line. The camera must be positioned at a high enough above the track to see an adequate section of what is ahead of the car, and its angle must be adjusted precisely so that it sees the desired part of the track.

The line-scan camera has two input signals, CLK and SI, and one analog output signal, A0. In order to initiate data transfer from the TSL-1401R camera, SI must go high for a brief duration (less than one period of CLK). This triggers the clocking out of data from the previous exposure on A0 (the timing of which is determined by CLK) and triggers the next exposure to begin. The 128 pulses of CLK following the pulse on SI define the time that the values captured by each of the 128 photodetectors during the previous exposure is read out on A0. This cycle repeats. The interval between the pulses on SI determine the exposure time \cite{ourLab6}. The integration time used for our car was 20 ms. The timing diagram in Fig. \ref{fig-camTiming} illustrates the described sequence of signals. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/biggerCamTimingDiagram.png}
    \caption{Line-Scan Camera Timing Diagram \cite{cameraTiming}}
    \label{fig-camTiming}
\end{figure}

The ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) on the MSP432 microcontroller digitizes each of the voltages output on A0 so that they can be used by the processor. When the car is on, the line-scan camera is continuously running to update the information about the car's environment. The location of the connections to the line-scan camera are displayed in Fig. \ref{fig-cameraWiring}.

  \caption[Short caption]{Wiring Diagram for Line-Scan Camera \cite{labManual} \fontsize{8pt}{10pt}\selectfont}
  \label{fig-cameraWiring}
\end{figure}

\subsection{DC Motors}
The two brushed DC motors interfaced with the MCU through the RPi MC33886 motor driver board. The driver board consisted of two H-bridges, one for each motor, that allowed the motors to be controlled without damaging the MCU, due to the high current demands of the DC motors. Additionally, the H-bridges allowed the direction of the motors to be controlled through swapping the direction that current flows thought the motor. 
The MCU used Timer A0 to set the PWM duty cycle of the two pairs of MSP432 output pins connected to the motor driver board to control the speed of the DC motors.  

\subsection{Servo}
The servo was controlled using PWM (pulse width modulation) at a frequency of 50 Hz (20 ms PWM period), which was implemented on the MSP432 board through the use of Timer A2. For this servo, the total range of motion was 120 degrees. Setting the PWM duty cycle to 5\% turned it fully to the left, 7.5\% centered it, and 10\% turned the servo fully to the right.

\section{Proposed Method}
\label{sec:method}

\subsection{Visual Center of Mass}
The line-scan camera pixel index corresponding to the center of the track, was determined by processing the raw data obtained using the line-scan camera connected to the A2D (Analog to Digital converter), which consisted of 128 values ranging from zero to 65,535 (in practice on the track approximately 15,000 was the max. value seen), corresponding to the magnitude of light intensity seen by each pixel. The raw data was processed in two steps, first smoothing, done in order to reduce the effect of visual noise in the data, and then summing. Smoothing the data was done through applying a five-point moving average of the 128 luminance magnitudes, by averaging the value of each pixel with the two on either side of it. Fig. \ref{fig-lineScanOutput} shows the effect of applying a smoothing filter to raw data from the line-scan camera.  

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/croppedLab5MATLAB.png}
  \caption[Short caption]{Raw and Filtered Line-Scan Camera Data \cite{ourLab5} \fontsize{8pt}{10pt}\selectfont}
  \label{fig-lineScanOutput}
\end{figure}

After the data had been smoothed, the index of the visual center of mass was then determined, as shown in \ref{eq:VCM} by summing the magnitudes of the smoothed data, and summing the indices of the data points which were weighted by the position in the array. The index of the visual center of mass was then found by dividing the weighted index sum by the summed magnitudes. The index of the visual center of mass corresponded to the center of the track.

\begin{equation}
    X_{center} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{mx}{M} \label{eq:VCM}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Carpet Detection}
In order to complete the first milestone, and for safety, the ability to detect if the car was on carpet instead of the track was required. This was achieved by comparing the magnitude of the smoothed data at the index corresponding to the visual center of mass. This magnitude value was then compared to a constant value determined through testing. If the magnitude at the visual center of mass was less than the predetermined threshold value, the car was determined to be on the carpet, and was stopped accordingly. 

\subsection{Servo Steering}
A function was written to convert an angle in degrees into an equivalent duty cycle, and to then modify the duty cycle of the PWM signal sent to the servo accordingly.
The difference in angle from the center line of the car to the center of the track was determined by subtracting the index of the visual center of mass from 64, which was half of the range of the pixels, and then multiplying the result by a steering scalar. The optimal value of this steering scalar was determined through experimentation during the first milestone such that the car would steer to the center of the track appropriately. The scaled difference, which now would be negative if the center of the track was to the left of the car, zero if the car was lined up with the center of the track, and positive if the track center was to the right, was used to set the steering in degrees. 

\subsection{Servo PID Control}
An algorithm for applying PID control to the steering of the front wheels was developed during the completion of Milestone Three. This algorithm was implemented as a function that took the desired difference in angle to the center of the track, which was always zero degrees, and the actual angle to the center of the track, as calculated in the regular steering function, and, using the Eqn. (\ref{eqn:pid}) output the optimal number of degrees to steer the servo. The PID algorithm kept track of the three prior steering errors. Values for Kp, Ki, and Kd were determined and adjusted through testing. 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:pid}
    u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int_{0}^{t} e(\tau) d\tau + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt} 
\end{equation}
    

\subsection{Speed Control}
 For all three milestones, the speed was simply set to a constant duty cycle, found through experimentation, that allowed the car to safely get around all turns of the track. This duty cycle was found to be about 38\%. 
 
During the preparation for the race, when optimizing the speed of the car a method of scaling the speed by the straightness of the ahead track was devised. The magnitude at the visual center of mass was taken. This magnitude was divided by a scalar, and the base speed was multiplied by the resulting scalar. This method allowed the car to accelerate to a higher speed on straights, but maintain a controllable speed when in corners. 

\subsection{Differential Thrust}
Differential thrust for turning was implemented in the design to supplement the limited range of motion inherent to the steering servo, which limited the maximum steering angle to 60\degree. The differential thrust aids in turning the car in a particular direction by slowing the rotation speed of the inner wheel by an amount proportional to the severity of the turn, by reducing the speed of the motor driving that wheel. The speed of the outer wheel was also very slightly increased in proportion to turn severity, however this was done only minutely, as too large of an increase made the car prone to spinning out. 

\subsection{Driving Modes}
In order to balance the goal of setting a fast lap time with the goal of successfully completing a lap of the track across the three attempts of the race, three driving modes were implemented in preparation for the race, each with a different level of tested reliability in completing the course successfully. The intent of the modes was to use the most aggressive one on the first attempt of the race, and if that attempt was unsuccessful, to use the medium mode in the next attempt. If the medium mode was unsuccessful, then the least aggressive mode would be used on the final attempt. 

The modes, listed from least reliable and fastest to most reliable and slowest, were “reckless”, “balanced”, and “conservative”. reckless mode (purple) drives the car at the highest reasonable speed which is useful for trying to get the car to complete the track in the fastest amount of time. The balanced mode (white) puts the car at the normal speed. While the last mode, the conservative mode (blue) brings the car to the lowest speed. 

Each of the modes corresponded to a particular set of car settings, implemented in code as three different structs, that modified items such as base speed, the turning scalar, and enabled and disabled certain functionality, like PID, differential thrust, and scaled speed controls. 
	
The driving modes were cycled through using a button on the MSP432, and the selected mode is indicated through the use of the RGB LED on the board. Each mode sets the LED to a corresponding color: reckless mode (purple), balanced mode (white), conservative mode (blue). Reckless mode had the highest base speed of 43\% duty cycle and nearly all of the features enabled, including PID steering. Balanced mode had a base speed of 40\% duty cycle, and all of the aforementioned features enabled, excluding PID steering, as it worked fine without it. The conservative mode disabled all but the most basic of features, and used a fixed speed of 35\% duty cycle. 

%This disabling of PID was not out of lack of effectiveness, however the PID algorithm used was incorrect up until the night prior to the competion, as we had used the algorithm from the slides, which was incorrect.

\subsection{Additional Functionality}
In order to avoid accidents when flashing or operating the car, arming and disarming functionality was implemented. When the car was disarmed, the DC motors and the servo were disabled, and they were enabled when it was armed. Button 2 of the MCU was used to toggle between armed and disarmed states. The status of the car was indicated using LED1. When the car was disarmed, LED1 was off, and it was turned on when armed. In order to avoid accidents, and for dramatic effect, a 1.5 second delay was added when transitioning from disarmed to armed, in which time LED2 would countdown by turning red, yellow, and then green when the car was in the armed state. 

When not being used to indicate mode selection or countdown the arming state, the color of LED2 was set based on the magnitude of the visual center of mass value, to provide useful insight about the car's perception when doing development and tweaking the camera position. 

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
Prior to race day, our car appeared poised to place in the top three spots during the race. During testing, across all of the different track configurations, our car, operating in balanced mode, had set the fastest unofficial times in a very consistent manner, when compared to other teams benchmarking and timing their cars. 

%with the exception of frying two MSP432P4111 boards due to having the zip tie on the interface board too tight, potentially leading to a short,

Knowing that the camera position was extremely important and sensitive to the performance of the car, we did not remove or adjust the camera between testing sessions and the day of the race. Despite this, when our five minute practice session arrived on the day of the race, the car drove straight off of the edge of the track. This is still unexplained, and we do not have any significant theories as to why this occurred. The most probable explanation is that we had not yet had a test track set up in the part of the room where the start line was, so the lighting could have been different, but this seems implausible, as we did all testing in that room, and the lighting seemed rather uniform. 

After not completing a single lap during our five minute practice session, we had to come up with a solution during the 40 minutes until the race. We set up an improvised test track outside of the race room using the few scrap pieces of track left over, which were mostly straight pieces, and adjusted the camera and parameters in the code, such as reducing the base speed of all modes to 35\% duty cycle, so that it could successfully navigate the improvised track. At that point, our only goal was to complete a lap at modest speed, which would still place us in the top seven teams. We also lowered the maximum speed to 40\% duty cycle, because we tuned on the improvised track in a dimly lit area, so we wanted to avoid the car going uncontrollably fast due to speed scaling with visual center of mass in the much brighter race room. We ultimately had to just hope that the modifications and tuning done on the improvised track would translate to the official one.

The configuration of the track on the day of the race consisted of two large loops consisting of several turns, one small loop, two intersections, and a hill, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig-trackCorner}.

\end{figure}

In the race, the car did not ultimately complete a lap around the track. In the first run, our car left the track for some unknown reason. In the second run, we set the mode to balanced, and the car made it quickly and smoothly about halfway around the track, however it ran off of the track in the marked position on Fig. \ref{fig-trackCorner}, which is marked with the points where each run left the track. The cause of this is assumed to be the  line-scan camera being angled too high, with the camera seeing too far ahead of the car causing the car to drive off course towards a different part of the track rather than stay on the continuous course. Run three had the same result, as in the high pressure situation of the race, we did not think clearly enough to angle the camera further down in between runs two and three. The improvised test track that we created and tuned on did not have the requisite turn pieces to emulate that section of the track, so going into the race we were not aware of the dangers posed by having the camera angle too high and seeing other runs of track nearby. 

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Ultimately this car did not place in the top seven in the TI Cup, nor did it finish a full lap,  but the design was successful in completing the three milestones prior to the race, and was fast and consistent in the days leading up to the race. Minor modifications to the physical placement of the line-scan camera would likely improve results in the future. The TI Cup was a beneficial opportunity for students to apply their classroom knowledge and problem-solving abilities in a real-world application.
